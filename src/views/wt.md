### What is this Initial Liquidity Offering?
The Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO) is aimed to bootstrap the X2Y2 token's initial liquidity on Uniswap.

- X2Y2 price at ILO would be: 1 X2Y2 = 0.0001 ETH â‰ˆ $0.25
- 15,000,000 X2Y2 tokens (1.5% of total supply) , divided into 1,000 slots (15,000 X2Y2 per slot), each to be sold for 1.5 ETH. A total of 1,500 ETH is expected to be raised.
- X2Y2 tokens sold at ILO are unlocked linearly per block within 360 days.
### What is the purpose of this event?
The goal of this event is to provide liquidity on Uniswap. After the sale, 10,000,000 (1%) X2Y2 tokens + 1,500 ETH will be put into Uniswap to create the initial liquidity. All LP Tokens will be burned to 0x...dead, thus locking the liquidity permanently.

### Has there been a private sale?
X2Y2 did not hold any private round to "strategic investors" and will only do a public liquidity pre-sale based on a whitelisting system: the Initial Liquidity Offering.

### What would happen if not all slots get sold?
If 1,000 slots does not get sold out during the ILO after the whitelisted sale and public sale, the remained slots will be burned and X2Y2 tokens to bootstrap the initial liquidity will also be reduced proportionally.

### Do I have to be whitelisted to join?
This ILO is open to whitelisted addresses during the first 16 hours. After then, if the 1000 slots are not sold out, the remaining slots are going into public sale so everyone could join in.

### What are the goods for joining the ILO?
- You get 15,000 X2Y2 tokens at a price(1 X2Y2 = 0.0001 ETH) much lower than the initial price on Uniswap(1 X2Y2 = 0.00015 ETH), linearly unlocking for 360 days.
- Share the X2Y2 NFT market fee earnings as long as you don't withdraw.
- You get qualified to claim a founder edition NFT of Ajin Youth Rebels, the official X2Y2 collection, for free later.
