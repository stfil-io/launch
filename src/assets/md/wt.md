### What is this Initial Liquidity Offering?
The Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO) is aimed to bootstrap the FIL token's initial liquidity on STFIL.

- stFIL price at ILO would be: 1 stFIL = 1 FIL â‰ˆ $4.5
- 500,000 stFIL tokens , divided into 1,000 slots (500 stFIL per slot), each to be sold for 500 FIL. A total of 500,000 FIL is expected to be raised.
- stFIL tokens sold at ILO are unlocked linearly per block within 360 days.
### What is the purpose of this event?
The goal of this event is to provide liquidity on STFIL.     After the sale, 500,000 FIL tokens will be put into STFIL to create the initial liquidity. As a reward, users will get an additional 1500 FDO for each slot purchased.

### What is the use of FDO token?
STFIL smart contract will regularly distribute dividends according to the proportion of FDO held by users.   This part of the income comes from the handling fee charged by STFIL.
