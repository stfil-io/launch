### What is this Initial Liquidity Offering?
The Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO) is aimed to bootstrap the FDO token's initial liquidity on Uniswap.

- FDO price at ILO would be: 1 FDO = 1 FIL â‰ˆ $0.25
- 15,000,000 FDO tokens (1.5% of total supply) , divided into 1,000 slots (15,000 FDO per slot), each to be sold for 1.5 FIL. A total of 1,500 FIL is expected to be raised.
- FDO tokens sold at ILO are unlocked linearly per block within 360 days.
### What is the purpose of this event?
The goal of this event is to provide liquidity on Uniswap. After the sale, 10,000,000 (1%) FDO tokens + 1,500 FIL will be put into Uniswap to create the initial liquidity. All LP Tokens will be burned to 0x...dead, thus locking the liquidity permanently.

### Has there been a private sale?
FDO did not hold any private round to "strategic investors" and will only do a public liquidity pre-sale based on a whitelisting system: the Initial Liquidity Offering.

[//]: # (### What would happen if not all slots get sold?)

[//]: # (If 1,000 slots does not get sold out during the ILO after the whitelisted sale and public sale, the remained slots will be burned and FDO tokens to bootstrap the initial liquidity will also be reduced proportionally.)

### Do I have to be whitelisted to join?
This ILO is open to whitelisted addresses during the first 16 hours. After then, if the 1000 slots are not sold out, the remaining slots are going into public sale so everyone could join in.
